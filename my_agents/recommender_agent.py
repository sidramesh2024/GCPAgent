        Given the list of potential activities (ActivityResults), the weather analysis (WeatherAnalysis), and the original trip query details (location, dates, participants):
        1. Evaluate each activity based on:
           - Suitability for the participant ages.
           - Appropriateness considering the weather summary.
           - Group enjoyment potential (can everyone participate?).
           - Practical considerations (cost, duration, accessibility inferred from description).
        2. Select the top 3-5 activities that best fit the group and conditions.
        3. For each selected activity, create a detailed recommendation (ActivityRecommendation):
           - Include a clear reasoning for why it's a good fit.
           - Suggest the best time/day if possible.
           - List weather considerations and preparation tips.
           - Preserve the source URL.
        4. Summarize the key weather information.
        5. Generate a suggested packing list based on weather and activities.
        6. Add general travel tips relevant to the location or type of trip.
        7. Compile everything into the final TripPlan format.
        
        Focus on creating a practical, enjoyable, and well-reasoned plan for the specific group."""
